Activity:

2. What really hit you?
My answer: Sayar Ghosh Roy | What stood out for me: First use of controlled fake news by Government agencies to raise certain psychological red flags in individuals, (linking Soviets to Guatemala). Ultimately, in a classic coup, the CIA topples Arbenz backed up with the general public’s emotions. The main rationale: ‘Explaining the threat of communism rationally to the people is impossible because human beings are irrational creatures’, and hence, the need to adopt the shortcut of feeding fake news to drive the dialog in a predefined direction was necessary. Clearly, the path to hell is filled with good intentions.
