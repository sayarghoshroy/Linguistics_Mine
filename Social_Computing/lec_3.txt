Lecture 3

- Talk on 'The Social Dilemma' reflections assignment
- Other perspectives on the whole - goals of engagement and growth and the monetary side
- One concept which most people have missed out: Digital Pacifiers: When do you tend to consume social consume? - when you are tired or bored or stressed - had a fight, start looking at social media.
- Champions wikipedia
- Money making aspect creates the problems for some reason

Nimmi Ma'am speaks: Look at it from the common man speaks. Selective kind of film-making - what has been left out - Christian Harris (they have made their money, all such people are ready to be instagrammers - my first thought was hippie). Being on the media platforms has become a habit. How to be critical to a film like this - not correct information on Wikipedia (so what exactly) - two-way street - TV: just a one way manipulation (since they don't have your data) - insturctors seem opinionated - Room discussion (again) - phase of moving from couch potatoes to active contributors on a platform

Countermeasure pointers are provided at the end. Multiple activities. Talking about activities for the day. What would you do the balance the ethical aspects and the profitability? (Make the countermeasures more explicit (whenever they load the App, show a few screens), Create a logical reasoning game for people to play)

Tech geeks more powerful than President - strongly disagree to such statements - the US government has more advanced technology.

Activity: 5 rooms. Imagine you are the tech leaders in those companies, what would you do to change the platform or modify the business model.
- Room 1: Facebook
- Room 2: YouTube (My Room)
- Room 3: Tiktok
- Room 4: Twitter
- Room 5: Instagram

Not show other aspect of the coin and promotes polarization: Is there a study on this? Personal experience: Since you are getting relevant content, it will be in line with your opinions: but it does show posts with differing opinions.
- Comparison to Wikipedia is plain stupid.
- Misconception that whole world is watching the same content: show statistics on what kind of content we are watching (right wing, conspiracy theories, show a person model visualization)
- Looking at time spent on certain posts: Where do you draw the line is a big debate.
- Good enough for a common man? It just makes them more paranoid. The social dilemma: the why? 
- Can fake news not spread through other means like text messages? If yes, then Facebook or Twitter or YouTube is not the cause or the culprit.
